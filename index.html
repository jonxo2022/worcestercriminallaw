A criminal index is a reference tool used by law enforcement to locate criminals. It contains information on known or suspected criminals, including their names, addresses, and criminal history. The index is designed to help law enforcement quickly find criminals so they can be apprehended and brought to justice. The index can also be used by employers to screen job applicants, and by landlords to screen tenants. In addition, the index can be used by the general public to find out if someone they know is a criminal. The index is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to keep their community safe from crime.
